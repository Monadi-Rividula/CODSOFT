            <b>William Henry Gates III </b> (born October 28, 1955) is an American businessman, investor, philanthropist, and writer best known for co-founding the software giant <b>Microsoft</b>, along with his childhood friend <b>Paul Allen</b>. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president, and chief software architect, while also being its largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He was a pioneer of the microcomputer
            revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
         </p>

         <p>
            Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued other business and philanthropic endeavors. He is the founder and chairman of several companies, including <b>BEN, Cascade Investment, TerraPower, bgC3,</b> and <b>Breakthrough Energy</b>. He has donated sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the <b>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</b>, reported to be the world's largest
            private charity. Through the foundation, he led an early 21st century vaccination campaign that significantly contributed to the eradication of the wild poliovirus in Africa. In 2010, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.
